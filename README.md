## 💬 How to Use the AI Chat Assistant

### **Best Practices for Effective Queries**

#### ✅ **DO:**
- **Be specific**: "Show Q2 2024 spending by entity" vs "show spending"
- **Use entity names**: Asheville, Tiger Group, etc.
- **Include time periods**: Q1, Q2, 2023, 2024, fiscal year
- **Ask for comparisons**: "Compare Q1 vs Q2 manufacturing costs"
- **Request trends**: "Show spending trends over time"

#### ❌ **AVOID:**
- Vague questions: "What's happening?"
- Missing context: "Show costs" (which costs? which period?)
- Calendar dates: Use fiscal quarters/years instead

### **Types of Questions FinSight Excels At**

#### **📈 Analytical Queries**
```
• "What entities have the highest manufacturing overhead?"
• "Show cost center performance by variance"
• "Which accounts drive the most spending volatility?"
```

#### **🔍 Semantic Search**
```
• "Find transactions similar to R&D equipment"
• "Show records related to facility maintenance"
• "Locate spending patterns like technology investments"
```

#### **📊 Trend Analysis**

```

- ✅ Be more specific to reduce query scope
- ✅ Check your internet connection
- ✅ AI models occasionally have high demand - system automatically switches to fallback
