# FinSight - Advanced Financial Transaction Analysis Platform

## Overview
FinSight is a comprehensive financial transaction analysis platform leveraging semantic search, vector embeddings, and specialized AI agents. Its purpose is to provide intelligent financial data analysis through a conversational interface, backed by PostgreSQL and advanced semantic catalog technology. The platform aims to revolutionize financial data analysis by offering conversational intelligence, detailed financial transaction insights, and interactive visualizations to aid strategic decision-making.

## User Preferences
I want to interact with the AI through a conversational interface. I prefer rich formatted responses with markdown rendering and interactive visualizations like bar charts and pie charts. I appreciate intelligent next-step recommendations and follow-up suggestions based on query context. The system should track my preferences for data format, analysis depth, and visualization style across sessions. I also expect real-time metadata like execution time, confidence scores, and model tracking with each response. I prefer a system that assesses my expertise level and adapts its interaction style accordingly.

## System Architecture
The platform is built with Next.js 15.2.4 (TypeScript) and uses PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension for semantic search. AI integration relies primarily on Gemini 2.5 Flash, with OpenAI GPT-4o Mini as a fallback. A custom semantic catalog, inspired by TimescaleDB pgai, is implemented with Google embeddings for intelligent querying. The UI is developed using Radix UI components, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts for data visualizations. The frontend serves on port 5000.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Advanced Data Agent:** Utilizes Gemini 2.5 Flash as the primary model for text-to-SQL financial transaction analysis, providing executive summaries, SQL analysis, and business insights. It includes a multi-model fallback system and semantic querying with automatic prompt routing.
- **Semantic Catalog System:** Provides database schema awareness, incorporates critical business constraints, and uses vector search for semantic retrieval of relevant context, integrating financial transaction domain knowledge.
- **Enhanced Conversational Intelligence:** Features context-aware memory, intelligent agent routing (Coupa, Baan, or combined agents), user learning and adaptation, contextual insights, follow-up suggestions, and persistent preference tracking.
- **Enhanced Database Layer:** Supports multi-dataset (financial and transaction data) with PostgreSQL and `pgvector`. It includes conversation intelligence tables for user profiles, conversation episodes, and context tracking, along with financial data aggregation functions.
- **Enhanced AI Agent Layer:** Comprises a Context-Aware Agent for memory and learning, a Smart Agent Router for query classification, specialized Coupa Financial and Baan Financial Transaction Agents, and a Conversation Context Manager.
- **Enhanced API Endpoints:** Includes `/api/agent` for conversational analytics, `/api/semantic-catalog` for management and search, `/api/embeddings/generate` for vector generation, and `/api/database/setup` for initialization.
- **UI/UX Decisions:** Implements a ChatGPT-style collapsible interface for chat history, professional sidebar design, and an artifact-style response system inspired by Claude.ai for presenting structured information.
- **Performance Optimization:** Incorporates Redis Caching Infrastructure for queries, conversations, embeddings, and chart configurations, resulting in significantly faster response times.
- **File Upload & Processing:** A complete pipeline for chart analysis, CSV processing, and document extraction, utilizing multimodal AI analysis via object storage.
- **LangGraph Memory Framework:** Advanced memory management supporting semantic, episodic, and procedural memory for cross-session persistence and user learning.
- **Visualization:** Integrates an advanced visualization and evidence system with automatic chart type selection (bar, pie, line, scatter), AI-generated insights, and production-ready frontend components using Recharts.

## External Dependencies
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with `pgvector` extension.
- **AI Models:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (primary), OpenAI GPT-4o Mini (fallback).
- **Embeddings:** Google embeddings.
- **Caching:** Redis.
- **Object Storage:** Replit object storage.
